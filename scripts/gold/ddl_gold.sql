DDL Script: Create Gold Views
=============================================================================================
Script Purpose:
    This script creates views for the Gold layer in the data warehouse.
    The Gold layer represents the final dimension and fact tables (Star Schema)
    
    Each view performs transformations and combines data from the Silver layer
    to produce a clean, enriched, and business-ready dataset.

Usage:
    - These views can be queried directly for analytics and reporting.

--1. Create dimension customers
--================================
-- Main Query
--================================
-- Since all the information below is describing the customer's information i.e. descriptive information thus it is a DIMENSION TABLE
-- SURROGATE KEYS: System-generated unique identifiers assigned to each record in a table
-- Either define it in DDL or Query-based using Window function(Row_Number)
IF OBJECT_ID('gold.dim_customers', 'V')
  DROP VIEW gold.dim_customers;
GO
  
CREATE VIEW gold.dim_customers AS
SELECT 
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY ci.cst_id) AS customer_key,		--> follow naming convensions that all surrogate keys should end with _key as suffix
	ci.cst_id AS customer_id,
	ci.cst_key AS customer_number,
	ci.cst_firstname AS first_name, 
	ci.cst_lastname AS last_name,
	la.cntry AS country,
	ci.cst_marital_status AS marital_status,
	COALESCE(NULLIF(ci.cst_gndr, 'n/a'), ca.gen, 'n/a') AS gender,
	ca.bdate AS birthdate,
	ci.cst_create_date AS create_date

ON		ci.cst_key = ca.cid
LEFT JOIN silver.erp_loc_a101 la

--2. Create Dimension Products
--===============================
-- Main Query
--==============================
-- This is the DIMENSION TABLE
IF OBJECT_ID('gold.dim_products', 'V')
  DROP VIEW gold.dim_products;
GO
  
CREATE VIEW gold.dim_products AS 
SELECT 
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY prd_start_dt, prd_key) product_key,  --> surrogate key

	pc.subcat AS subcategory,
	pc.maintenance,
	pn.prd_cost,
	pn.prd_line AS product_line,

FROM silver.crm_prd_info pn
LEFT JOIN silver.erp_px_cat_g1v2 pc ON pn.cat_id = pc.id
WHERE pn.prd_end_dt IS NULL		--> filter out all historical data
GO






-- 3. Create fact_sales
-- The crm_sales_details is connecting multiple dimensions as it has multiple measures values and dates and keys thus it is a FACT TABLE
IF OBJECT_ID('gold.fact_sales', 'V')
  DROP VIEW gold.fact_sales;
GO

	sd.sls_due_dt AS due_date,
	sd.sls_sales AS sales_amount,
	sd.sls_quantity AS quantity,
	sd.sls_price AS price
